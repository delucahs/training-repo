# Sam's Training Repository
Hello, Matthew!

Github:
- Can create public repos with no cost
- Private ones cost money
- Apparently gitlab provides the same thing as github, but doesn't charge anything for public vs. private

Questions:
- Would I be allowed to download and install github desktop?
- Would I be allowed to use either powershell or the cmd line?

Next Steps:
- Take an intro gitlab course
